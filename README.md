# RentalStore

Online Van rental store for small business

## Description

RentalStore is my first React web application. My attempt at building a small commerce website for a small business in the vacation van rental industry. 
Once a customer arrives on the main page they are directed to the inventory fleet to select from a variety of camper vans to choose for their journey. Once a selection has been made and the  relevant information entered they are prompted to make a payment via paypal,debit or any major credit card brand.

## Project Status
Workflow is currently working as intended, payments are being processed. Backend to store relevent userinfo will be built as part og the .node.js project.


### Motivation
When deciding on what to build to help me learn REACT, I took inspiration from a friend who is currently trying to open a small business in that industry.


### Reflection
As I was/ am new to React frameworks this was a deepdive  which presented several learning opportunities into how to go about developing a realworld application. Not only did I come to find react projects are implemented differently but they also interact differently with github pages and other libraries. I was able to implement a 3rd party payment processing feature using paypal which was another challenge in itself. Lots of reading, researching and setting up developer sandbox accounts involved. Many lessons learned along the journey.

### Interacting with the page
Sample Credit Card info to complete transaction on the page. PS this is a developer CCard generated by Paypal for testing with their PaypalButtons.
Feel free to use it to test the features on the page.
Card Number: 4032033509450453
Expiration Date: 02/2027
CVV: 658

### Features
Made use of localstorage to mimic  a backend feature which prevents the user from booking a vehicle which is already booked for given dates.
