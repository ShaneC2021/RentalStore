# RentalStore

Online Van rental store for small business

## Description

RentalStore is my first React web application. My attempt at building a small commerce website for a small business in the vacation van rental industry. 
Once a customer arrives on the main page they are directed to the inventory fleet to select from a variety of camper vans to choose for their journey. Once a selection has been made and the  relevant information entered they prompted to make a payment via paypal,debit or any major credit card brand.

## Project Status
Workflow is currently working as intended, payments are being processed. Some of the UI still being polished and a few minor bugs with regard to screen refreshes need to be fixed. (About 85-90% complete at this point).

### Motivation
When deciding on what to build to help me learn REACT, I took inspiration from a friend who is currently trying to open a small business in that industry.

### Reflection
As I was/ am new to React frameworks this was a deepdive  which presented several learning opportunities into how to go about developing a realworld application. Not only did I come to find react projects are implemented differently they also interact differently with github pages and other libraries. I was able to implement a 3rd party payment processing feature using paypal which was another challenge in itself. Lots of reading, researching and setting up developer sandbox accounts involved. Lots of lessons learned along the journey.
